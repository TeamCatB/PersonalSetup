Unbound and wireguard will need to be setup for homeassistant, but for now we're going to bake the tunnel into caddy and bypass the cloudflare proxy and dynamic dns shit

alternatively you could maybe set the dynamic dns inside Caddy?


next time I'll do a wireguard tunnel wired up to an http server w/ a dns server
then pipe requests out from the main caddy reverse proxy into it
